# 💼 Salary Prediction Using Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **salary based on experience** using **Machine Learning regression techniques**.  
It walks through the complete ML pipeline — from data collection to model evaluation — using Python.

The goal is to understand how different regression models perform and how well they can predict salaries from real-world data.
