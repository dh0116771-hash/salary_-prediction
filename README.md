## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**

Each model is trained and evaluated to compare performance.

---

## 📉 Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using appropriate regression metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

Visualizations are also used to understand model performance.
